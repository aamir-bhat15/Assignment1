    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases. \n",
    "Ans: Database is the process of storing the data in one place. \n",
    "Through database we can manage our data, manipulate, add, delete etc. \n",
    "SQL: Structured Query Language also called relational database. \n",
    "SQL requires us to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of our data before we work with it. \n",
    "Also, all of our data must follow the same structure. \n",
    "NoSql: Not only SQL also called non-relational database. \n",
    "A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. \n",
    "Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store."
